# Long Bio

Shanfan Huang is a designer who sees design as a way of thinking—a lens for identifying patterns, telling stories, and inspiring action. With a background in product UX design and agile software consulting, she has coached enterprise IT teams on user-centric design methodology, rapid user research, and evidence-based product strategy.

Now working in data visualization, she applies the same rigorous thinking—“What’s our hypothesis? What’s the evidence? What’s the insight? What’s the takeaway?”—to craft clear, compelling narratives. Her work bridges graphic design, UX, interaction, and storyboarding, blending analytical precision with creative expression to make complex information accessible and engaging.
