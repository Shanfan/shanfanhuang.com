		<h2>Context</h2>
		<p>
			As we enter the 5th year since COVID-19, the world feels a lot different than what it was
			before. Many people left their previous jobs, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to pursue
			something different in life, including myself. Having worked in the tech industry for most of
			my career, Iâ€™m intrigued by the shifting landscape of this industry. The dataset from
			<a href="https://layoffs.fyi" target="_blank">layoffs.fyi</a>, compiled by
			<a href="https://www.rogerlee.com/" target="_blank">Roger Lee</a>, which tracks tech layoff
			announcements reported by major news outlets, became a starting point for this analysis.
		</p>
		<h2>Analysis & Exploration</h2>
		<p>
			When I receive a dataset, my first step is to understand the broader context implied by the
			labels used in the dataset. After initial research and scoping, I decided not to focus on the
			announcement dates or geographic locations. Instead, I treated the 5-year period as a cohesive
			whole, aiming to uncover shifts in industries and startups during this unique turning point of
			history. To do this, I aggregated layoff announcements by company and explored correlations
			across different sectors.
