		<h2 class="cursive">2020 ~ 2025: the nebulous shift of the tech industry</h2>
		<p>
			Between March 11, 2020 and April 16, 2025, tech companies around the globe conducted series of
			layoffs, impacting people working in many different industries. This essay explores data
			shared on <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank">Layoffs FYI</a> using interactive charts.
		</p>
		<p>
			To ensure clarity, I rolled up the original dataset, in which each row represents a layoff
			announcement in the news, by company. I also simplified the classification of the funding
			stage of a company. See <a href="the-fuzzy-work/behind-the-scene">Behind the Scene</a> for details.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="main-content">
		<h2>Layoff impact on industries</h2>
		<p>
			The chart below compares the number of companies announced layoff events and the number of
			jobs eliminated in each industry.

		<ComparisonBar data={rollupByX('industry')} measure={'Industry'} />

		<p class="footnote">
			&ldquo;Other&rdquo; included companies such as Microsoft, Miro, Oracle, and Asana.
		</p>
		<p class="footnote">
			&ldquo;Infrastructure&rdquo; refers to information networking companies such as Cisco, VMware,
			New Relic, Docker, and BitTorrent.
		</p>
		<p class="footnote">
			Google and Meta are classified under &ldquo;Consumer&rdquo;, whereas Apple is in
			&ldquo;Hardware&rdquo; and Amazon &ldquo;Retail&rdquo;, although they all have businesses in
			different industries.

			Relatively few hardware companies made layoff announcements, yet the jobs eliminated in this
			field is quite high.

		<h2>Layoff impact on companies at different funding stages</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="main-content">
		<p>
			The chart below compares the number of companies and the number of jobs eliminated at
			different funding stages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Publically traded companies are often the large employers, and they could also eliminate the
			largest number of jobs in times of uncertainty.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the past 5 years, {layoffByCompany[0].company} eliminated {layoffByCompany[0].layoff} jobs in
			total, making it to the top for job loss, followed by {layoffByCompany[1].company},
			eliminating {layoffByCompany[1].layoff} jobs, and {layoffByCompany[2].company}, {layoffByCompany[2]
				.layoff}.
		</p>
		<p>
			Early-stage companies are more susceptible to economic shifts at large, hence more likely to
			announce layoffs or even go bankrupted, but they tend to have much less impact on the job
			loss.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of {bankrupted.length} companies announced 100% layoffs, assuming bankrupcy, {bankrupted.filter(
				(d) => d.stage === 'Early Stage'
			).length} are at an early funding stage. That is, 1 in 3 companies announced 100%-layoff is at
			early funding stage.
		</p>
	</div>
	<aside>
		<p class="insight">
			Among all the tech giants, Apple only eliminated {layoffByCompany.find(
				(d) => d.company === 'Apple'
			)?.layoff} jobs, and
